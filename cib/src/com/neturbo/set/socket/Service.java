/**
 * Here is the Service interface that we have seen so much of.  It defines
 * only a single method which is invoked to provide the service.  serve()
 * will be passed an input stream and an output stream to the client.  It
 * should do whatever it wants with them, and should close them before
 * returning.
 *
 * All connections through the same port to this service share a single
 * Service object.  Thus, any state local to an individual connection must
 * be stored in local variables within the serve() method.  State that
 * should be global to all connections on the same port should be stored
 * in instance variables of the Service class.  If the same Service is
 * running on more than one port, there will typically be different
 * Service instances for each port.  Data that should be global to all
 * connections on any port should be stored in static variables.
 *
 * Note that implementations of this interface must have a no-argument
 * constructor if they are to be dynamically instantiated by the main()
 * method of the Server class.
